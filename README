A small utility to rank lists.

Idea based on Flickchart.

2/6/14- Initial implementation. Got it up and running in a js console, now working on porting it to 
jquery/html so i can dump it on a website and let other people use it. Ugly and shitty, but technically works.

Future updates will make it all run normally on the page instead of alert boxes, and will include CSS so it doesn't
look so bare.
